# Felix's Agile Journey

Welcome to my personal blog! I'm Felix, an engineer‑turned‑Scrum Master at Siemens, where I help cross‑functional teams deliver innovative solutions. My background bridges software development and mechanical engineering, and I've spent years writing tools, visualising results and fostering collaboration.

## Featured article: Illuminating the Path and Soaring Beyond Barriers

In my latest post I reflect on the journey from improving quality through an "Inspective Light" to breaking organisational silos with "Transparent Wings". I explain how OKRs anchored our team to quality, and share practices such as sprint retrospectives and post‑mortems. I've included diagrams from my own material to make these concepts visual and easy to understand.
